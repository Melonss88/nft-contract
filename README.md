This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.  

Try running some of the following tasks:  

```shell
npx hardhat help
```  

```shell
npm i
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat node
```
